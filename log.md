# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: August 10, 2020

**Today's Progress**:Installed python for windows.Read about variables, strings, ints and floats in python and how they are manipulated. I did the excercices of the book.

**Thoughts:** Overall, I think it's easy so far since I already have a background in programming. But reading about the basics again is refreshing.

**Link to work:** No links.


### Day 1: August 11, 2020

**Today's Progress**:I read about lists in python and diffrent ways to access elements, add, remove, slice and copy a list. I did the two first excercices of the chapter4.I'm at page 64.

**Thoughts:** Overall, I think it's easy so far since I already have a background in programming. But reading about the basics again is refreshing.I'm also satisfied with my progress so far and the book is very good! I'll continue the chapter tomorrow and read about tuple and the if statement.

### Day 2: August 12, 2020

**Today's Progress**:I read about conditional statments, and dictionnaries in python and the different ways to use them. I finished the excercises concerning the lists in chapter 4 and those about if statements and dictionnaries. I'm at chapter 6 page 112.

**Thoughts:** I have a better understanding of dictionaries now and the different ways to use them in python. The book is just so easy to read and keeps you intertained. I'll dive into user input, while loops, and functions in chapter 7 and 8.

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
